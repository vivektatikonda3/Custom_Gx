# The pip resolver became more strict starting with version 20.3
# This constraints file is "a way to specify global (version) limits for packages"
# without specifying the install of these packages.
# See also: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files
# We use it to place limits on certain packages to help the resolver come to a compatible configuration more quickly
# To install dev dependencies using the new pip resolver (recommended) please use the following syntax:
# `python -m pip install -c constraints-dev.txt ".[test, postgresql, spark]"`

# Several capitalone_dataprofiler_expectations that use tensorflow started
# dying with the following error from site-packates/google/protobuf/descriptor.py
#		TypeError: Descriptors cannot not be created directly.
#		If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
#		If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
#		 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
#		 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).
